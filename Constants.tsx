I hope to use my platform to help other talented students from humble beginnings have the same opportunity."',

This comprehensive legislation represents the culmination of three years of advocacy efforts by education advocates, nonprofit organizations, and—significantly—by Beacon-funded scholars.',
          'The bill will directly benefit an estimated 2.5 million students currently burdened by student loan debt, provide $5 billion in new funding for minority-serving institutions, and establish new pathways for students in rural and economically disadvantaged communities to access higher education.'

          'The Higher Education Equity Act includes several major provisions that will transform American higher education. Student Loan Forgiveness: Borrowers with federal student loans earning less than $65,000 annually will have up to $15,000 forgiven immediately. Income-Driven Repayment creates a new income-driven repayment plan capping monthly payments at 5% of discretionary income. Institutional Funding provides $5 billion in new federal funding for historically Black colleges and universities. Rural Education Initiative invests $2 billion in expanding broadband and educational infrastructure.',

          'Maya Rodriguez, a Beacon Scholar from Texas, testified before the Senate Education Committee about her experience with student debt and the transformative impact of scholarship funding. Her testimony was cited by three senators in floor speeches supporting the bill.'

          'The Beacon Foundation is working with partner institutions to ensure that our scholars and their families are aware of these new benefits. We\'re also planning a national summit in June 2026 bringing together policy makers, advocates, and scholars to discuss implementation and next steps in the ongoing work toward education equity.'

This research addresses those limitations by using self-assembling nanoparticles to deliver genetic instructions more efficiently, reducing the off-target effects that limit current therapies.',

"This fellowship gave me the freedom to tackle a truly difficult problem that I believed in, not just the problem that was easiest to fund."',

Several major pharmaceutical companies and venture capital firms have already expressed interest in licensing and developing the technology.',
          'More immediately, the three researchers are training additional graduate students in their methods and working with institutions worldwide to establish clinical trial sites. They\'ve also committed to making their research open-source, allowing other scientists to build on their work.',
